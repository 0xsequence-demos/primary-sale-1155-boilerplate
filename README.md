# Sequence Primary Sale 1155 Boilerplate

Starter Sequence boilerplate demonstrating how to perform primary sales of 1155 NFTs using Sequence.

## Quickstart

Use pnpm to install dependencies:

```js
pnpm install
```

This will also copy `.env.example` to `.env` if `.env` doesn't exist yet.

You can use the pre-provided env vars to test things out.

Run the project locally:

```js
pnpm dev
```

The app will start on `localhost:4444`

To provide your own keys from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/), simply edit the `.env` file accordingly.
